                                The Lapa is situated on a private farm Volstruisvlei, 10Km outside Velddrift on the Pieketberg road. 
                                The Lapa is approx 30 km from the 2 main West Coast towns namely: Vredenburg and Langebaan.
                                So this means, you are close to all the golf courses in the area as well as the sea, while experiencing a magic bush break-way. 
                                The flower season and the crayfish season are all popular times. The Lapa is in the middle of the bush surrounded with nature and the night sounds.
                                This concept was originally started as a family break-away, but has turned so popular due to the location of the venue. 
                                Guests experience the best of many worlds as they peacefully sit around the camp fire. 
                                You need a 4X4 to get from the mainfarm house to the Lapa, which is appox 2.5km into the bush.
